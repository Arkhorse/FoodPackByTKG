### Special Thanks
---
- Special thanks to WulfMarius who first created the Food Pack.
- Special thanks to ds5678 who took the project from WulfMarius and expanded it by adding 13 more food items as well as adding more spawn spots.

### Localization
---
Currently, the mod is supported by the following languages; English, German, Russian, Polish, French, Turkish, Korean, Italian and Simplified Chinese.

### Introduction
---
Due to ds5678's unfortunate departure from the modding site, the mod was left with no modder or an interested user who could get it to work with the latest version of the game as well as maintain it by adding new spawn spots, balance it if needed and so on.

I decided to take over the project mainly because I love food pack varieties. This and Waltz's food pack (https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/FoodsByCalorieWaltz) were the only mods in the community that would bring a lot food item varieties.
