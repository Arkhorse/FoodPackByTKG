### Introduction

Introduces 38 new food items to the game.

Due to ds5678's unfortunate departure from the modding site, the mod was left with no modder and seemingly nobody was interested to try to get it to work with the latest version of the game as well as maintaining it by adding new spawn spots, balance it if needed and so on.

If you are considering to download and install this Food Pack, I strongly recommend you download and install Waltz's food pack ((https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/FoodsByCalorieWaltz)) as well. Both of these mods will bring significant food varieties. This mod was expanded with Waltz's mod in mind.

Food items will be rarely found in cars, caves, etc or in places that they wouldn't make much sense. This food pack will work excellently with Waltz's Food Pack.

### 5.0 Version
---
- NEW: Added Can of Jalapenos.
- NEW: Added Flour Bag.
- NEW: Added Noodles.

If you are using my Noodles mod, delete it as it has been merged with this food pack mod.
