### Special Thanks
---
- Special thanks to WulfMarius who first created the Food Pack.
- Special thanks to ds5678 who took the project from WulfMarius and expanded it by adding 13 more food items as well as adding more spawn spots.

### Localization
---
Currently, the mod is supported by the following languages; English, German, Russian, Polish, French, Turkish, Korean, Italian and Simplified Chinese.

### Introduction
---
Due to ds5678's unfortunate departure from the modding site, the mod was left with no modder and seemingly nobody was interested to try get it to work with the latest version of the game as well as maintain it by adding new spawn spots, balance it if needed and so on.

I decided to take over the project mainly because I love food mod packs. This and Waltz's food pack (https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/FoodsByCalorieWaltz) were the only mods in the community that would bring a lot food item varieties. 

If you are considering to download and install this Food Pack, I strongly recommend you download and install Waltz's food pack as well. The link is posted above. Both of these mods will bring significant food varieties. This mod was expanded with Waltz's mod in mind.

### Installation
---
- If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running MelonLoader.Installer.exe
- Install the latest version of ModComponent and its dependencies.
- Download latest version of FoodPackByThekillergreece.modcomponent from the releases page.
- Move Food-Pack.modcomponent to your mods folder.
- (OPTIONAL) Download latest version of Foods by 'Calorie Waltz' from their releases page.
- (OPTIONAL) Move the mod's modcomponent and all files to mods folder.

### 4.5 Version
---
The Update 4.5 does not bring any new items but it does ton of new spawn spots across the world.
Most of these food items will be spawned within interiors, especially houses and stores. Food items outside in regions may spawn but less frequently. You are better off finding these food items mainly in houses and stores than in cars and anywhere else. 

### My Thanks
---
Special thanks to Waltz, DigitalZombie, Emma and whoever I shamefully forgot for helping me out reviving this project in TLD modding discord.
